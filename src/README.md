# Pytorch implementation of GAN based Video Super Resolution 

The goal of this project is to Upscale any video to a higher resulution using a Generative Adversial Network. 


## REQUIREMENTS 
Python 3.7+
PyTorch
OpenCV 
Prefarably NVIDIA CUDA enabled GPU 


## Datasets

For the training I've used DIV2K dataset that can be found here: https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/DIV2K/

## Papers 
Inspired by  Photo-Realistic Single Image Super-Resolution Using a Generative Adversarial
Network Paper  https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04802
